# Portfolio

A web portfolio is a personal or professional website designed to showcase an individual's work, skills, and accomplishments, particularly for people in creative fields like web development, design, writing, photography, and more. A strong web portfolio acts as an online resume, demonstrating your expertise, creativity, and ability to create and present digital content.
